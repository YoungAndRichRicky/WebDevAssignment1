        <h1>Life Cycle and Reproduction of Sea Turtles</h1> <br>
        <p>When mature female sea turtles return to their birth beaches to lay eggs, the extraordinary odyssey that is their life cycle officially begins. Nesting, egg incubation, hatching, and the subsequent growth and development of the hatchlings into adult turtles are the several steps that make up the process.</p>

         <img src="Images/turtLifeCycle.png">

    </div>

    <div class="lifeCycDescrip">
        <ul>
            <li>Nesting Process</li> 
            <p>In order to lay their eggs, female sea turtles make their way back to the beach where they were hatched after emerging from the water. This navigational prowess is referred to as "natal homing." Once on the sand, the female places a clutch of eggs within a nest she digs with her rear flippers. In order to protect the eggs, she carefully covers the nest before heading back to the water.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li>Egg Incubation</li> 
            <p>Incubation of sea turtle eggs takes place in the warm sand of the nesting beach. The sex of the hatchlings is significantly influenced by temperature. Male hatchlings typically develop at cooler temperatures, whereas females do so at warmer temps. Depending on the species, the incubation period might be anywhere between 45 and 70 days.</p>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>Hatching</li> 
            <p>The hatchlings grow inside the eggs as the period of incubation comes to a conclusion. When prepared, they crack open the eggshell with a special temporary tooth called a caruncle. After then, the hatchlings leave the nest and walk up to the sand's surface.</p>
            <br><br>
            
            <li>Emergence and Disorientation</li> 
            <p>When the hatchlings emerge from the water, they use cues like the beach's slope, the gradient of the ambient light, and the moon's or stars' reflection on the water's surface to point them in the direction of the ocean. However, artificial lighting from adjacent sources might throw them off balance, divert them from the water, and make them more vulnerable to predators or other dangers.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li>Journey to the Ocean</li> 
            <p>The risky voyage across the beach towards the water begins once the hatchlings successfully orient themselves toward the sea. They follow their instincts and the horizon's light for direction. Predators, unlevel ground, and human disturbances are just a few of the challenges they must overcome, but those who make it to the water have a higher chance of surviving.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li>Early Oceanic Stage</li>
            <p>The early oceanic stage of an animal's existence begins when it enters the water. They disperse into the vast ocean, frequently using surface characteristics like currents to facilitate their travel. They must contend with predators, food scarcity, and hazards brought on by humans like pollution and fishing gear during this period.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li>Juvenile and Adult Growth</li>
            <p>Those hatchlings that make it through this phase of rapid growth and development eventually become juveniles. They live in environments along the coast and offshore, like coral reefs, seagrass beds, and shallow coastal waters, where they can find an abundance of food. Sea turtles need a number of years to mature sexually, which can take anywhere from 10 to 50 years depending on the species. Growth rates vary depending on the species.</p>

    <p>Understanding the sea turtle's life cycle and reproduction can help us better understand their biology, behavior, and the difficulties they encounter throughout their lifespan.

        <h1>Threats and Conservation</h1> <br>
        <p>Several threats put the populations and survival of sea turtles in Sri Lanka at jeopardy. The following are some serious dangers to sea turtles in Sri Lanka:</p>

                <div class="threatright">
                    <p>Sea turtles are seriously threatened by pollution, particularly plastic waste. Plastic bottles, bags, and fishing equipment can all be mistaken for food, resulting in entanglement and ingestion that can result in harm, internal damage, or even death. The health and survival of sea turtles can be impacted by pollution from industry and inefficient waste management, which can contaminate nesting beaches and foraging grounds.</p>

                <div class="threatleft">
                    <p>Due to demand in local markets and illegal international trade, sea turtles and their eggs are frequently illegally taken for their meat, shells, and eggs. Poaching of turtle eggs and adults for human consumption or traditional medicine uses continues to be a serious problem in Sri Lanka, having an effect on genetic diversity and population size.</p>            
                </div>

                <div class="threatright">
                    <p>Sea turtles are susceptible to bycatch, or accidental capture in fishing gear. Turtles may unintentionally be caught and drowned during trawling, gillnetting, and longline fishing operations. The significance of this issue is especially great where fishing operations affect sea turtle habitats, such as foraging grounds and migration paths.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="conservation">
    <p>Through community involvement, government legislation, and conservation organizations, efforts are being made in Sri Lanka to address these issues. In order to reduce these dangers and guarantee the sea turtles' long-term existence in Sri Lanka, it is essential to implement conservation programs, tougher law enforcement, awareness campaigns, and sustainable fishing techniques.</p>
